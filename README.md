# Age-and-Gender-Predictio
Python program to predict age and gender of a person

In this I have tried to predict age and gender of a person from their facial feature with two different approaches.

To run it just copy the above mentioned files to the code directory and run the py file from terminal with
python age_and_gender_prediction.py
or run it from an IDE.
This approach uses caffeemodel to try to predict the age and gender.

In the second file "age-gender-prediction-real-time.py" we use pretrained weights from deep face library "age_model_weights.h5" and "gender_model_weights.h5" to try to predict the age and gender.

Download those two files and copy them to the code directory. Run the py file from Terminal with
python age-gender-prediction-real-time.py
or with IDE or run the Jupyter Notebook "realtime.ipynb".
